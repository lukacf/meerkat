## What is Meerkat?

Meerkat is a **library-first, modular agent harness** — a set of composable Rust crates that handle the hard parts of building agentic systems: state machines, retries, budgets, streaming, tool execution, MCP, multi-agent coordination.

It is designed to be **stable** (deterministic state machine, typed errors, compile-time guarantees) and **fast** (&lt;10ms cold start, ~20MB memory, single 5MB binary).

The library comes first; surfaces come second. The CLI, REST API, JSON-RPC server, MCP server, Python SDK, and TypeScript SDK are all thin layers over the same engine.

## Quick start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rust">
    Add Meerkat to your `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    meerkat = "0.1"
    tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
    ```

    ```rust
    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let result = meerkat::with_anthropic(std::env::var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")?)
            .model("claude-sonnet-4-5")
            .system_prompt("You are a helpful assistant.")
            .run("What is the capital of France?")
            .await?;

        println!("{}", result.text);
        Ok(())
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    pip install meerkat-sdk
    ```

    ```python
    from meerkat import MeerkatClient

    async with MeerkatClient() as client:
        await client.connect()
        result = await client.create_session(prompt="What is the capital of France?")
        print(result.text)
    ```

    Requires the `rkat` binary on your `PATH`. See the [Python SDK guide](/sdks/python).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    npm install @meerkat/sdk
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { MeerkatClient } from "@meerkat/sdk";

    const client = new MeerkatClient();
    await client.connect();
    const result = await client.createSession({ prompt: "What is the capital of France?" });
    console.log(result.text);
    await client.close();
    ```

    Requires the `rkat` binary on your `PATH`. See the [TypeScript SDK guide](/sdks/typescript).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    cargo install --path meerkat-cli

    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
    rkat run "What is the capital of France?"
    ```
  </Tab>

## Modularity

Pick only what you need. Disabled capabilities return typed errors — no panics, no silent degradation.

```toml
# Minimal: just the agent loop + one provider
meerkat = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["anthropic"] }

# Add persistence and compaction
meerkat = { version = "0.1", features = ["anthropic", "session-store", "session-compaction"] }

# Everything
meerkat = { version = "0.1", features = ["all-providers", "session-store", "session-compaction", "memory-store-session"] }
```

## Surfaces

All surfaces share the same `SessionService` lifecycle and `AgentFactory` construction pipeline.
