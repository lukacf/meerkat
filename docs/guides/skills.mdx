Skills inject domain-specific knowledge into the agent's context. A skill is a markdown document with YAML frontmatter that gets included in the system prompt or per-turn context when its required capabilities are available.

## Skill sources

Skills are discovered from multiple sources, in precedence order:

1. **Project** (`.rkat/skills/`) — highest precedence
2. **User** (`~/.rkat/skills/`)
3. **Git repositories** — cloned to local cache, refreshed on TTL
4. **HTTP endpoints** — fetched from remote skill servers
5. **Embedded** (builtin skills from component crates)

<Note>
A project skill with the same ID as a builtin skill overrides the builtin (first-source-wins).
</Note>

### Git sources

Configured in `.rkat/skills.toml`. Uses gitoxide (pure Rust, no git CLI dependency):

```toml
[[repositories]]
name = "company"
transport = "git"
url = "https://github.com/company/meerkat-skills.git"
git_ref = "main"
ref_type = "branch"    # "branch", "tag", or "commit"
refresh_seconds = 300  # TTL for branch refs (tags/commits are immutable)
depth = 1              # shallow clone depth
# auth_token = "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"  # optional, env vars expanded
```

### HTTP sources

```toml
[[repositories]]
name = "remote"
transport = "http"
url = "https://skills.example.com/api"
# auth_bearer = "${SKILLS_API_KEY}"
cache_ttl_seconds = 300
```

## SKILL.md format

Each skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Shell Patterns
description: "Background job workflows: patterns and tips"
requires_capabilities: [builtins, shell]
---

# Shell Patterns

When running background jobs...
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `String` | Yes | Display name for the skill |
| `description` | `String` | Yes | One-line description |
| `requires_capabilities` | `Vec<String>` | No (default `[]`) | Capability IDs that must be available |

The frontmatter is delimited by `---` markers. The body (everything after the closing `---`) is stored as the skill's `body` field.

## Capability gating

Skills are filtered by their `requires_capabilities` field before being shown or injected:

- A skill is included only if **all** its required capabilities are available in the current build/config.
- A skill with an empty `requires_capabilities` list is always available.

## Skill resolution

The resolver supports two reference formats:

1. **Slash-prefix ID**: `/skill-id` -- matches against `SkillDescriptor.id`.
2. **Exact name match** (case-insensitive): `"Shell Patterns"` or `"shell patterns"` -- matches against `SkillDescriptor.name`.

Resolution returns `SkillError::NotFound` if no match, or `SkillError::Ambiguous` if multiple skills match.

Resolution mode:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `Explicit` | Only explicit `/skill-id` or exact name matches |

## Rendering

The renderer produces two output formats:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inventory section">
    Generates a `## Available Skills` section listing all available skills for the system prompt:

    ```text
    ## Available Skills

    - `/task-workflow` -- How to use task_create/task_update/task_list for structured work tracking
    - `/shell-patterns` -- Background job patterns with shell and job management tools
    ```

    This section is injected into the system prompt via the `extra_sections` parameter of `assemble_system_prompt()` in `meerkat/src/prompt_assembly.rs`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Injection block">
    Wraps the skill body in XML-style tags for per-turn injection:

    ```xml
    <skill name="Shell Patterns">
    # Shell Patterns

    When running background jobs...
    </skill>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Size limits

`MAX_INJECTION_BYTES` is set to 32 KiB (32 * 1024 bytes). If an injection block exceeds this limit, it is truncated with a warning log.

## Built-in skills

The following skills are embedded in component crates:

| ID | Name | Crate | Required capabilities |
|----|------|-------|----------------------|
| `hook-authoring` | Hook Authoring | `meerkat-hooks` | `hooks` |
| `shell-patterns` | Shell Patterns | `meerkat-tools` | `builtins`, `shell` |
| `task-workflow` | Task Workflow | `meerkat-tools` | `builtins` |
| `sub-agent-orchestration` | Sub-Agent Orchestration | `meerkat-tools` | `sub_agents` |
| `mcp-server-setup` | MCP Server Setup | `meerkat-mcp` | (none) |
| `memory-retrieval` | Memory Retrieval | `meerkat-memory` | `memory_store` |
| `session-management` | Session Management | `meerkat-session` | `session_store` |
| `multi-agent-comms` | Multi-Agent Comms | `meerkat-comms` | `comms` |

## Configuration reference

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `skills.enabled` | `true` | Enable skill loading |
| `skills.max_injection_bytes` | `32768` (32 KiB) | Maximum size of injected skill content |
| `skills.inventory_threshold` | `12` | Flat listing below, collection mode above |

## Custom skills

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project-level">
    Create a subdirectory under `.rkat/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file:

    ```
    .rkat/skills/
      my-deployment/
        SKILL.md
    ```

    Example `.rkat/skills/my-deployment/SKILL.md`:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: Deployment Guide
    description: Project-specific deployment procedures
    requires_capabilities: []
    ---

    # Deployment Guide

    1. Run `make build` to create the release binary.
    2. Deploy via `./deploy.sh production`.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User-level">
    Same structure under `~/.rkat/skills/`. These are available across all projects but have lower precedence than project-level skills.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Discovery tools

When skills are active and builtins are enabled, two tools are registered:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browse_skills` | List skill collections and search by name/description |
| `load_skill` | Load a skill's full instructions into the conversation |

In collection mode (when there are more than 12 skills), the system prompt shows collection summaries. The LLM can use `browse_skills` to explore collections and `load_skill` to activate specific skills.

## Invoking skills

Skills can be activated in three ways:

### 1. Slash reference in user message

Include `/skill-id` at the start of a message:

```
/extraction/email Extract the sender from this email
```

The agent detects the reference, resolves the skill, and injects its body before running the LLM.

### 2. Programmatic skill_references (per-turn)

Pass `skill_references` in the API request to resolve and inject skills for a specific turn:

```json
{
  "method": "turn/start",
  "params": {
    "session_id": "...",
    "prompt": "Extract emails from this text",
    "skill_references": ["extraction/email"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Preloading at session creation

Pass `preload_skills` to inject skills into the system prompt at session creation:

```json
{
  "method": "session/create",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "Hello!",
    "preload_skills": ["extraction/email", "formatting/markdown"]
  }
}
```

See the [Python SDK](/sdks/python/reference#skills-parameters) and [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/reference#skills-parameters) for SDK wrappers.

## Configuration

Skills are configured in `.rkat/skills.toml` with user/project layering:

```toml
# ~/.config/rkat/skills.toml (user) or .rkat/skills.toml (project)
enabled = true
max_injection_bytes = 32768    # max size of injected skill content
inventory_threshold = 12       # flat listing below, collection mode above

[[repositories]]
name = "company"
transport = "git"
url = "https://github.com/company/skills.git"
```

Project settings override user settings when the project file exists. Repositories are merged (project repos take precedence over user repos with the same name).
