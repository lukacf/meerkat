This runbook defines the required operator workflow for skill source identity changes.

## Canonical Identity

- Canonical identity is `SkillKey { source_uuid, skill_name }`.
- `source_uuid` is immutable unless changed through lineage events.
- Runtime execution paths consume canonical identity only.

## Required Source Record Fields

Every source identity record must include:

- `source_uuid`
- `display_name`
- `transport_kind`
- locator `fingerprint`
- `status` (`active` or `retired`)

## Governance Checks

Startup rejects:

- UUID collisions with conflicting fingerprints unless lineage explicitly permits.
- UUID mutation without lineage.
- split/merge/rotate lineage without complete per-skill remap coverage.

## Migration Procedures

### Rotate (one source to one source)

1. Add lineage event `rotate` from old UUID to new UUID.
2. Add remap rows for all affected skills (`old_uuid/skill` -> `new_uuid/skill`).
3. Deploy config and verify canonicalization tests pass.

### Split (one source to many)

1. Add lineage event `split` with all target UUIDs.
2. Add explicit per-skill remaps from old UUID to exactly one target UUID per skill.
3. Reject deployment if any source skill lacks remap coverage.

### Merge (many sources to one)

1. Add lineage event `merge` with all origin UUIDs and target UUID.
2. Add explicit per-skill remaps from each origin UUID skill to target UUID skill.
3. Reject deployment if any origin skill lacks remap coverage.

## Incident Recovery

If startup fails with lineage/remap validation:

1. Freeze rollout and keep prior registry active.
2. Fix missing remaps or incorrect lineage edge.
3. Re-run identity migration tests:

```bash
cargo test -p meerkat-core --test skill_identity_migrations
```

4. Roll forward only after tests pass and resolver-boundary canonicalization is verified.
