Skills inject domain-specific knowledge into the agent's context. A skill is a markdown document with YAML frontmatter that gets included in the system prompt or per-turn context when its required capabilities are available.

## Skill sources

Skills are discovered from three locations, in precedence order:

1. **Project** (`.rkat/skills/`) -- highest precedence
2. **User** (`~/.rkat/skills/`)
3. **Embedded** (builtin skills from component crates)

<Note>
A project skill with the same ID as a builtin skill overrides the builtin (first-source-wins).
</Note>

## SKILL.md format

Each skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Shell Patterns
description: "Background job workflows: patterns and tips"
requires_capabilities: [builtins, shell]
---

# Shell Patterns

When running background jobs...
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `String` | Yes | Display name for the skill |
| `description` | `String` | Yes | One-line description |
| `requires_capabilities` | `Vec<String>` | No (default `[]`) | Capability IDs that must be available |

The frontmatter is delimited by `---` markers. The body (everything after the closing `---`) is stored as the skill's `body` field.

## Capability gating

Skills are filtered by their `requires_capabilities` field before being shown or injected:

- A skill is included only if **all** its required capabilities are available in the current build/config.
- A skill with an empty `requires_capabilities` list is always available.

## Skill resolution

The resolver supports two reference formats:

1. **Slash-prefix ID**: `/skill-id` -- matches against `SkillDescriptor.id`.
2. **Exact name match** (case-insensitive): `"Shell Patterns"` or `"shell patterns"` -- matches against `SkillDescriptor.name`.

Resolution returns `SkillError::NotFound` if no match, or `SkillError::Ambiguous` if multiple skills match.

Resolution mode:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `Explicit` | Only explicit `/skill-id` or exact name matches |

## Rendering

The renderer produces two output formats:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inventory section">
    Generates a `## Available Skills` section listing all available skills for the system prompt:

    ```text
    ## Available Skills

    - `/task-workflow` -- How to use task_create/task_update/task_list for structured work tracking
    - `/shell-patterns` -- Background job patterns with shell and job management tools
    ```

    This section is injected into the system prompt via the `extra_sections` parameter of `assemble_system_prompt()` in `meerkat/src/prompt_assembly.rs`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Injection block">
    Wraps the skill body in XML-style tags for per-turn injection:

    ```xml
    <skill name="Shell Patterns">
    # Shell Patterns

    When running background jobs...
    </skill>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Size limits

`MAX_INJECTION_BYTES` is set to 32 KiB (32 * 1024 bytes). If an injection block exceeds this limit, it is truncated with a warning log.

## Built-in skills

The following skills are embedded in component crates:

| ID | Name | Crate | Required capabilities |
|----|------|-------|----------------------|
| `hook-authoring` | Hook Authoring | `meerkat-hooks` | `hooks` |
| `shell-patterns` | Shell Patterns | `meerkat-tools` | `builtins`, `shell` |
| `task-workflow` | Task Workflow | `meerkat-tools` | `builtins` |
| `sub-agent-orchestration` | Sub-Agent Orchestration | `meerkat-tools` | `sub_agents` |
| `mcp-server-setup` | MCP Server Setup | `meerkat-mcp` | (none) |
| `memory-retrieval` | Memory Retrieval | `meerkat-memory` | `memory_store` |
| `session-management` | Session Management | `meerkat-session` | `session_store` |
| `multi-agent-comms` | Multi-Agent Comms | `meerkat-comms` | `comms` |

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `skills.enabled` | `true` | Enable skill loading |
| `skills.max_injection_bytes` | `32768` (32 KiB) | Maximum size of injected skill content |

## Custom skills

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project-level">
    Create a subdirectory under `.rkat/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file:

    ```
    .rkat/skills/
      my-deployment/
        SKILL.md
    ```

    Example `.rkat/skills/my-deployment/SKILL.md`:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: Deployment Guide
    description: Project-specific deployment procedures
    requires_capabilities: []
    ---

    # Deployment Guide

    1. Run `make build` to create the release binary.
    2. Deploy via `./deploy.sh production`.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User-level">
    Same structure under `~/.rkat/skills/`. These are available across all projects but have lower precedence than project-level skills.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Invoking skills

Include a skill reference (e.g., `/shell-patterns`) in the user prompt to invoke it. The agent resolves the reference, loads the skill, and injects its content into the turn context.

See the [Python SDK](/sdks/python#skillhelper) and [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript#skillhelper) for `SkillHelper` wrappers that handle this automatically.
