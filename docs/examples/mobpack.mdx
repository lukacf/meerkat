## Pack a mob directory

Bundle a mob directory into a single portable `.mobpack` artifact containing the definition, skills, hooks, and config.

```bash
rkat mob pack ./mobs/release-triage -o ./dist/release-triage.mobpack
```

## Sign a pack

Attach an Ed25519 signature at pack time for trust verification on deploy.

```bash
rkat mob pack ./mobs/release-triage \
  -o ./dist/release-triage.mobpack \
  --sign ./keys/release.key
```

## Inspect a pack

View the contents, metadata, and signature status of a `.mobpack` without deploying.

```bash
rkat mob inspect ./dist/release-triage.mobpack
```

## Validate a pack

Check structural integrity, schema conformance, and signature validity.

```bash
rkat mob validate ./dist/release-triage.mobpack
```

## Deploy a pack

Run a `.mobpack` as a live mob with a prompt. The trust policy controls whether unsigned or unknown-signer packs are accepted.

```bash
rkat mob deploy ./dist/release-triage.mobpack \
  "triage latest regressions" \
  --trust-policy strict \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-5
```

Deploy to an RPC service instead of one-shot CLI:

```bash
rkat mob deploy ./dist/release-triage.mobpack \
  "boot triage service" \
  --surface rpc
```

## Trust policies

| Policy | Unsigned packs | Unknown signers | Invalid signatures |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `permissive` | Allowed (warns) | Allowed (warns) | Rejected |
| `strict` | Rejected | Rejected | Rejected |

Trust policy resolution order:

1. CLI flag: `--trust-policy strict`
2. Environment variable: `RKAT_TRUST_POLICY=strict`
3. Config file: `trust.policy` field
4. Default: `permissive`
