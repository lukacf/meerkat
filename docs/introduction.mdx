description: "Meerkat is a library-first agent engine built in Rust. Provider-agnostic, modular, fast."
---

Meerkat is an agent engine, not an agent product. Claude Code and Codex CLI are finished applications -- Meerkat is what you'd build them on.

It's a set of modular Rust crates that handle the hard parts of agentic systems: state machines, retries, budgets, streaming, tool dispatch, MCP, multi-agent coordination. You bring your own prompts, tools, and opinions. Meerkat handles execution.

## Why Meerkat

- **Fast.** Rust from the ground up. Single 5MB binary, &lt;10ms cold start, ~20MB memory. No runtime, no garbage collector, no dependency tree to manage.
- **Provider-agnostic.** Same code, same tools, same sessions across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini. Switch models with a config change. Run a Claude parent that spawns GPT sub-agents.
- **Modular.** Eighteen crates, all opt-in. Need just the agent loop? Pull in `meerkat-core`. Need session persistence? Add `meerkat-store`. Need inter-agent comms? Add `meerkat-comms`. Your binary includes only what you use. Disabled features return typed errors, not panics.
- **Stable.** Deterministic state machine with defined transitions. Typed errors with compile-time guarantees. Every error code maps to a stable string across JSON-RPC, REST, and CLI exit codes.
- **Controlled.** Hard budget limits on tokens, wall-clock time, and tool calls. Eight hook points for guardrails, audit, and content rewriting. Shell security with allow/deny lists.
- **Multi-agent native.** Sub-agents spawn on different providers with isolated budgets. Independent agents communicate over Ed25519-signed channels. Compaction + semantic memory handles conversations that exceed any context window.

### How it compares

| | Meerkat | Claude Code / Codex CLI / Gemini CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **Design** | Library-first, modular crates | CLI-first, SDK bolted on |
| **Modularity** | Compose only what you need | Monolithic, all-or-nothing |
| **Performance** | Single 5MB binary, &lt;10ms startup, ~20MB RAM | Runtime + dependencies |
| **Languages** | Rust core + Python & TypeScript SDKs | TypeScript or Python |
| **Surfaces** | CLI, REST, JSON-RPC, MCP server, language SDKs | Rich interactive TUI |
| **Multi-agent** | Native Ed25519-authenticated P2P messaging | No |
| **Memory** | HNSW semantic indexing + auto-compaction | File-based context |

Those tools excel at interactive development with rich terminal UIs. Meerkat has no TUI -- it's for automated pipelines, embedded agents, multi-agent systems, and anywhere you need programmatic control over an agent engine.
